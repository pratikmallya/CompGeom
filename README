            ======================================================

This project is my attempt to implement some of the cool algorithms that I
learnt about in a class on Computational Geometry @ Illinois.
Note that this is mostly for my reference and learning. The purpose of making
it available was mostly to provide the most simplistic implementation using
python.If you are looking for professional quality computational geometry 
software, then checkout CGAL (http://www.cgal.org/)
